Furthermore, I can keep the browsing history intact until the session expiration page, but when I attempt to navigate to the login page, the entire history is wiped clean.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I reached out to @rithviknishad , who suggested revisiting the query parameter approach. Now, the recommendation is to check if the origin of the redirect URL matches the origin of care.\r\n\r\n@Ashesh3 , I'm currently implementing the query parameter approach. "
